# The Open Source Party

The Open Source Party is an application of Open Source software development methodology to political organization. It is a framework for groups to define how they will interact.

Although the initial use case is a political party, we believe the project is also appropriate for use by software development teams, established companies, and government agencies.


## Core Philosophy

* Government is a collection of rules, like any imperative program
* Radical Transparency
* Constant Constituent / Representative Feedback
* Data Driven Policy Decisions
* Open Source: governing rules should be available and *intelligible* to all

## Project Structure
The Project is composed of three core documents

###	Manifest
	The manifest document explains the group's reason for existing. It should answer a few essential questions. What do we hope to accomplish? Why were the existing solutions insufficient? The Manifest should also include a brief overview of how the group plans to accomplish it's goals

###	Platform
	The Platform document explains in detail how the group plan to accomplish it's goals. This is the core operating guideline for the group and will be the document that changes most often. It is where the majority of merge requests will take place. Depending on the complexity of the group and it's goals the Platform document may expand into a nested folder structur.

###	Charter
	The group's Charter document defines the rights and responsibilities of its members, and how they will interact with one another. It should address: membership qualifications and joining process, the contribution process, procedures for debate and voting, the responsibilities of officers, and dispute resolution.

	Many projects will also link to an external App project. The App project is the actual software the groups uses to conduct its operations.



## Set Up
We encourage contribution to the core project regardless of your geographical location. The method for creating a new Open Source Party locally should be forking the core project.


## Contributing
This is an open source project, and an early stage work in progress. If you have any suggestions about how we can improve the project, please join the Slack discussion or submit a merge request.
