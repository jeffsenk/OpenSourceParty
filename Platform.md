## Space Exploration
The exploration of the universe beyond our planet earth is an inevitable step in human progress. If the United States does not lead this effort, someone else will. And if we are not there to direct the course of space exploration, there is nothing to guarantee the power that does will not be hostile.

If nothing else, we simply need to establish human habitation outside the earth for diversification.

## Environmental Conservation
The maintenance of a healthy ecosystem is essential is essential to the operation of a healthy economy, and a healthy and happy populace. We contend that the question of mankind's impact on climate change is secondary: why live in a world where our water supply is polluted? Where the air is full of toxins? If clean, renewable energy is possible, why not use it?

## Funding for Fundamental Scientific Research
Advances in Physics, Chemistry, and Biology benefit not only American society but all of mankind. However these discoveries are often too time consuming for private industry to take the risk. Here the government must socialize the risk and widely distribute the eventual reward.

## Education in Hard Sciences
The first step in creating a world class scientific research community is primary and secondary education in Math, Science, and Computer Literacy. Given the United States' dominant position in the world tech industry, our low standing in the educational rankings is unacceptable.

Education must also be viewed as a continuing, lifelong process. As the economy rapidly changes and evolves, so too must our workforce continually learn new skills. We propose the establishment of an adult education system.

## Internet Neutrality and Freedom
Access to the internet is a basic human right. And just as traditional businesses are required to provide equal service to all customers, so too must the ISPs supply unbiased service. As the internet has become the dominant means of communication and public discourse, we must work to ensure that every voice is given equal stature.

## Public Infrastructure
Our highways, airports, and fibre optic networks are all in need of an overhaul. A solid public infrastructure provides the foundation on which private business may flourish. Large government works projects are also an essential source of employment for middle class citizens.

## Immigration Reform?
