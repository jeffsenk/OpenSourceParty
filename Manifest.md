#The Open Source Party Of the United States Manifest


##The Purpose of Democratic Government
We hold that every democratic government is entrusted with two sacred duties: to protect the rights of its citizens, and to promote the common interest. Every other duty of government derives from one of these two. In pursuing these goals, the government has two sources of guidance: the popular will of the people, and the wisdom of its elected representatives.

We assert that the current government of the United States no longer represents the majority of Americans. Both parties have been taken over by ideological extremists. The most fanatical voices speak loudest. Meanwhile the moderate voice of the great mass of American citizens goes unheard. 

>The Squeaky Wheel gets the grease

The representatives elected to represent these ideologues hold fundamentally irreconcilable views. Thus the legislature has become mired in stalemate over inconsequential issues and it is completely incapable of exercising leadership. Our country has stopped pursuing the ambitious goals of a properly functioning democracy.

The news media portrays the United States as a “polarized” society, “blue states” and “red states.” We believe this is a false dichotomy. It is not the American citizenry that is incapable of compromise and pursuing a common interest. It is the current political system that empowers narrow fractions.

##The Open Source Party
Although the polarization of American politics can be partially blamed on the emergence of social networking technology, the solution is not less communication. The solution is a government that fully comprehends the power as well as the risks of technology, and is able to filter and channel the multitude of voices into a productive direction. The unfortunate truth is that most of the politicians in office today are technically illiterate and unqualified to face the challenges of the 21st century. 
The advent of the internet at the end of the 20th century presented an inflection point in human history. Large, entrenched companies that had been in business for decades were faced with an ultimatum: embrace the new paradigm, or be replaced by a nimbler competitor. Most of the largest tech companies in the world today did not exist pre-1990. 

We assert that the US government is at a similar turning point. The dominant political parties have failed to properly harness modern communication technology, and in the process broken faith with those they were sworn to represent. In order to re-establish the moderate majority as the leading force in American politics, and define a clear path forward into the 21st century, we propose the establishment of a new political party.

>The operating system of our republic is due for an upgrade.

The name of this party is the **Open Source Party**. The name is meant to reflect our aims of radical transparency and inclusion of Americans from all walks of life, as well as a focus on technological growth as the means toward shared prosperity.

>Government is perhaps the last systemically important sector of American society that has yet to be fundamentally transformed by modern communication technology. The Constitution of the United States is over 240 years old, and was composed at a time when the fastest medium of communication was a messenger on horseback. The younger of the two major political parties, the Republican Party, was formed in 1854. If neither party is able to elucidate a path forward that appeals to the majority of Americans, then it is time for a new party.

#Platform
The Open Source Party platform is composed of two main sections: Communication and Leadership. These sections refer to the two guiding forces of a democratic government: the will of the people and the wisdom of its elected representatives.


##Communication
Our communication strategy is composed of three tools. These are the tools we use internally to inform decisions within the party; we will work toward establishing parallel tools within the government.

###Structured Data Platform
Although the modern world is flooded with communication, most of that data is unstructured. For example email: when you receive an email, there is no way of knowing ahead of time how long it will be, what it is about, or even what language it is in. An email must be read and interpreted by a human to extract the data it contains.

The problem is not that constituents do not contact their representatives. The problem is that they contact them so much that congress is overwhelmed. Each congressperson is allowed a limited number of staffers who must parse every individual piece of mail. Electronic communication has made it so easy for everyone to have a voice that everyone speaks and no one is heard. Instead of direct communication, congresspersons rely on well-funded lobbyists and interest groups to collect data and compile it into a sensible format.

Our solution is a structured data platform for mobile devices and the web. Instead of email, voters are presented with a selection of issues and bills currently under consideration by congress. The voter is then asked to express their opinion (for or against), and may add any supporting arguments which will appear in the comment thread. The congressperson is then presented with data they can quickly and easily make sense of: how many voters are for or against a specific bill, sorted by various demographic factors such as age, location, ethnicity etc. Once the representative votes on the issue, their position is then published on the same platform.

The first tenet of our communication strategy is constant feedback: there is no reason why a voter’s email should disappear into a black hole, or the only interaction you have with your government comes every 4 years. Communication can be instant and meaningful, and it should be.


###Radical Transparency
The second tenet of the communication strategy is radical transparency. We believe that all members of the party should be privy to how decisions are made within the party. All official communication and debate is to be conducted on the OS Party Slack channel, where the logs are auditable and may be stored indefinitely. 

The ultimate goal is for all debate and communication between sitting members of Congress to eventually be migrated onto a digital platform, where it is made available for public viewing. We believe that full transparency will go a long way to improve trust in the political system.

###Online Voting
The first tool deals with votes where the electorate’s opinion matters, but the decision ultimately comes down to the representative. In other cases, such as a Presidential election, a binding vote by the citizenry is required. During the 2016 Presidential election, under 60% of the eligible populace voted. Voter turnout for local elections are typically below 30%.

The current ballot process requires voters to appear at a designated polling location, typically during a weekday. This unfairly disadvantages those with restricted mobility, or financial / professional constraints that keep them from arriving at the designated time. But more fundamentally, it creates an inconvenience out of something which should be quick and effortless.

We propose that all official votes at the local, state, and national levels be migrated onto a digital (and preferably mobile) platform. By lowering the barrier to participation, we expect a much higher participation rate and thus a more accurate reflection of the people’s will. The tools exist today to remotely verify a voter’s identity using biometric data. We simply lack the political will to use them.

##Leadership
It is not enough for an elected official to channel the views of the electorate. He or she must also define a path for collective action. Our Leadership strategy is composed of two sections that refer to the two essential duties of government: promotion of the common interest and protecting the rights of the citizenry.


##Common Interest
Promotion of the common interest can be broken down into three sub-categories: Economic Prosperity, Education, and Public Infrastructure.

###Economic Prosperity
We hold that the engine of economic development is and has always been technological progress. The explosive growth of the United States from an agrarian backwater into an industrialized superpower during the 19th century was the direct result of adopting new technologies such as the steam locomotive, the cotton gin, and the telegraph. To ensure economic prosperity, the government should do everything it can to promote technological advances.

###Regulation
Here the Democrats and Republicans both have part of the puzzle. Regulation must not be overly restrictive (the Republican view) to encourage innovation, and entrepreneurs must have the rights to their intellectual property. However, innovation must not come at the expense of consumer protection (the Democratic view), and the benefits of new inventions must be made as widely available as possible. A delicate balance must be struck between the rights of innovators and the rights of the public they depend on.

###Funding
The second tool the government has at its disposal for encouraging technological advance is funding with taxpayer money. Specifically government funding should be reserved where the risk is too great to be borne by any one individual or private company, and the benefits accrue to society as a whole. We focus on 6 key initiatives:

###Space Exploration: 
The exploration of the universe beyond our planet Earth is an inevitable step in human progress. If the United States does not lead this effort, someone else will. And if we are not there to direct the course of space exploration, there is nothing to guarantee the power that does will not be hostile.

If nothing else, we need to establish human habitation off planet as an insurance policy. The Earth is routinely threatened by cataclysmic natural events, any one of which could wipe out human civilization. We need to diversify our real estate.

###Environmental Conservation:
The maintenance of a healthy ecosystem is essential to the operation of a healthy economy, and a healthy and happy populace. Mankind's impact on climate change is a contentious issue in the  US, but we maintain that the question is secondary. why live in a world where our water supply is polluted if we don't have to? Whether or not man contributes to climate change, wouldn't you prefer clean air for your children? If clean, renewable energy is possible, why not use it?

###Funding for Fundamental Scientific Research:
Advances in Physics, Chemistry, and Biology benefit not only American society but all of mankind. However these discoveries are often too time consuming for private industry to take the risk. Here the government must socialize the risk and widely distribute the eventual reward.

###Education in Hard Sciences:
The first step in creating a world class scientific research community is primary and secondary education in Math, Science, and Computer Literacy. Given the United States’ dominant position in the world tech industry, our low standing in the educational rankings is unacceptable.

Education must also be viewed as a continuing, lifelong process. As the economy rapidly changes and evolves, so too must our workforce continually learn new skills. We propose the establishment of an adult education system.

###Internet Neutrality and Freedom:
Access to the internet is a basic human right. And just as traditional businesses are required to provide equal service to all customers, so too must the ISPs supply unbiased service. As the internet has become the dominant means of communication and public discourse, we must work to ensure that every voice is given equal stature.

###Public Infrastructure
Our highways, airports, and fibre optic networks are all in need of an overhaul. A solid public infrastructure provides the foundation on which private business may flourish. Large government works projects are also an essential source of employment for middle class citizens.

Large government projects do not need to be a drain on taxpayer resources. When administered in the right fashion, these programs are engines of job creation and sources of scientific breakthroughs that are profitably applied in the private sector.


##Protecting Citizen’s Rights
American citizens’ rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness may be threatened by both domestic and foreign sources. Domestically, it is the police and courts that protect us. Internationally, it is the Armed Forces.

###Domestic Threats
Our social policy is a simple application of the liberty principle: a consenting adult may do anything he or she wishes with their own property, physical person or mind, so long as it does not impinge on the liberty of another. 

There are many groups in the United States today that would reduce the liberty of other Americans. We will work to ensure that they do not succeed.

###Foreign Threats
Our dependance on the internet in almost every aspect of life also creates new security threats. As the 2016 election showed, the US is not fully prepared to address the threat of state-backed hackers. We propose increased funding for cybersecurity in the US armed forces. We also support funding for remote military capabilities to put fewer American service men and women in harm’s way.

##Data Driven Policy
The final plank of the Open Source Party platform is data driven decision making. Whenever a policy decision must be made, whether in the arenas of education, public spending, or the military, it must be backed by quantifiable metrics showing why it is the best course of action. The Party does not make decisions based on the whim of a single representative or the lobbying of an interest group. Every decision must be shown to fulfill one of the two mandates of government: the greatest good for the greatest number of people, or the protection of a vulnerable group.


##Conclusion
There was a time, not long ago, when the American government was capable of true leadership. In 1961 President Kennedy outlined an ambitious plan to accelerate the space program, with the twin goals of ensuring American preeminence in space and democracy on earth. The nation rallied to his call, and a mere 8 years later a man walked on the Moon. The politicians of today are mired in skirmishes about minor issues that divide our country, while the crucial issues with the potential to unite the country fall by the wayside. It is time for the government to lead again. It is time to guarantee that the American Century becomes the American Millennium. It is time for the Open Source Party.

>“We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.” -JFK
